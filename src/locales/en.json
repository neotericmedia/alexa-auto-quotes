	"helpBuildResponsePostalCodeCategorySpeech": "The area where you live plays a big part in how risky your car is to insure. Places with higher rates of accidents, theft and vandalism will typically see higher insurance premiums, because insurers incorporate these location-specific risk factors into the quote.

A driver’s age is a general measure of driving experience and accident risk. Based on statistics and past experience insuring other drivers, the more years behind the wheel that a driver has, the less likely he or she is to get into an accident and submit a claim for reimbursement. This typically means that he or she will cost less to insure, which means a cheaper quote. Are you 25 years or above ?",

	"helpBuildResponseGenderCategorySpeech": "Age can be a significant factor in the determination of insurance rates. Women may pay less for car insurance than men do. The major difference stems from the difference in risk between female and male drivers in their youth. As drivers reach 25 years old, their risk goes down, as they are considered as more mature, settled, and safe on the roads. At this point, rates tend to begin evening out among men and women.
